    Question:
    Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
    between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
    The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
    

    Test:
    >>> result = solution(input)
    >>> success = True
    >>> for x in result:
    ...     if x % 7 != 0 or x % 5 == 0:
    ...         success = False
    ...         break
    ...
    >>> success
    True
