    Question 4
     
    Level 1
    
    Question:
    Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
    Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
    34,67,55,33,12,98
    Then, the output should be:
    ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
    ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
    

    Test:
    >>> input = '34,67,55,33,12,98'
    >>> result = solution(input)
    >>> result
    ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
    ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
