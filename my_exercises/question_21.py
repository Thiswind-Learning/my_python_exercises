    Level 3
    Question£º
    A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
    UP 5
    DOWN 3
    LEFT 3
    RIGHT 2
    ¡­
    The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
    Example:
    If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
    UP 5
    DOWN 3
    LEFT 3
    RIGHT 2
    Then, the output of the program should be:
    2
