    Question:
    The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
    f(n)=0 if n=0
    f(n)=1 if n=1
    f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
    Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence in comma separated form with a given n input by console.
    Example:
    If the following n is given as input to the program:
    7
    Then, the output of the program should be:
    0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13
